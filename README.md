# Bike_Sales_Dashboard
This Excel file, titled Bike Sales Dashboard, is centered on analyzing customer demographics and their relationship to bike purchases.
The dataset contains detailed information about individuals, including marital status, gender, income, number of children, education level, occupation, home ownership, number of cars owned, commute distance, region, and age.
The key outcome variable is whether or not the customer purchased a bike. This makes the dataset ideal for exploring patterns in consumer behavior and identifying the types of customers most likely to buy bicycles.
The purpose of the project is to provide insights into sales and marketing strategies by segmenting customers based on their profiles. For example, analysts can examine how income levels influence bike purchases, whether younger or older age groups are more inclined to buy, and how commute distance affects the likelihood of choosing a bike. Regional comparisons, such as Europe versus the Pacific, can highlight geographic differences in consumer preferences. Similarly, lifestyle indicators like car ownership and family size can be analyzed to understand how they impact purchasing decisions.
A dashboard built from this dataset would typically visualize these relationships, showing trends such as bike purchase rates by income bracket, age distribution of buyers versus non-buyers, and occupation or education patterns among customers. 
These insights help businesses tailor their marketing campaigns, identify target segments, and optimize product positioning. In essence, the project demonstrates how demographic and lifestyle data can be transformed into actionable business intelligence using Excel dashboards.
